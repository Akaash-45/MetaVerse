# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## MetaVerse 2D Virtual Space Platform

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the software requirements for the MetaVerse 2D Virtual Space Platform.

#### 1.2 Scope

The platform enables users to create and join virtual spaces with customizable avatars, interact in real-time, and manage virtual assets.

### 2. System Architecture

#### 2.1 High-Level Design

The system follows a client-server architecture with:

- React-based frontend with Phaser for 2D rendering
- Node.js backend with Express
- MongoDB for data persistence
- WebSockets for real-time communication

#### 2.2 Detailed Design

##### 2.2.1 Frontend Components

- Authentication Module: Handles user login/registration using Clerk SDK
- Avatar Selection Module: Allows browsing and selection of avatars
- Space Management Module: Creates, joins, and manages virtual spaces
- Phaser Game Module: Renders the interactive game scene

##### 2.2.2 Backend Components

- User Service: Manages user data and authentication
- Room Type Service: Handles different types of virtual rooms
- Asset Service: Manages virtual assets and their properties
- WebSocket Service: Enables real-time communication

### 3. Naming Conventions

#### 3.1 File Naming

- React Components: PascalCase (e.g., `AvatarGrid.tsx`)
- Services/Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `roomTypeService.ts`)
- API Routes: camelCase (e.g., `roomTypesRouter.ts`)

#### 3.2 Database Collections

- Collection names: snake_case for constants (e.g., `RoomType_Collection`)
- Interface names: Prefix with "I" (e.g., `IRoomType`)

#### 3.3 Function Naming

- Service functions: camelCase, descriptive verbs (e.g., `getAllRoomTypes()`)
- API endpoints: RESTful conventions
